### Assignment 1:

Read and Understand the above articles

### Assignment 2:

Make a Metaverse presentation from the Articles you have read in Assignment 1 using Google slides. 
Please Donot share the slides with anyone except me, until I instruct you to do so.

Five reasons we are doing this:

1. When making something we remember
2. To make a summary of the material
3. To teach others from this material
4. Have reference material for ourselves
5. To see who are the leaders and best workers in this group

## Learning 3D with Blender

Blender development is being funded by heavyweights in the real-time 3D (RT3D) space such as Apple, Unity, AMD, Intel, Meta, NVIDIA, AWS, Epic Games, Adobe, Microsoft, and Decentraland. It is expected to become the standard asset creation tool for metaverse.
